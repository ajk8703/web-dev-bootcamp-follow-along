        <!-- ANOTHER TYPE OF FORM INPUT-->
        <!--
            Rather than having our inputs nested inside of label,
            our alternate sytax is to say "for" and "id" which match your
            "for" label, and your "id" input!! To compare UwU

            With this, we also don't have to nest label and input in this case! That's p much that functionality, it just connects
            the two without nesting.
